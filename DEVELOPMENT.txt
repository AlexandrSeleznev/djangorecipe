This is the django recipe development branch.
Djangorecipe has grown

Versions, VCS and Eggs
======================
The main focus of the development branch is removal of the
subversion code and the start of using django eggs.

Versions
--------

Version specifies a version, but is also magic.
It can be a django version number, an svn url or 'trunk', the django trunk.
It comes from the time that django didn't have a proper 1.0 release
and everybody used trunk or 0.9X.

VCS
---

Due to subversion support, there is a need for other version control
systems as well. There are different buildout recipes for there
systems. It's possible to drop subversion support when djangorecipe
uses eggs.

Eggs
----

Now Django is more mature other projects depend on Django being installed.
Djangorecipe install django in parts and as such it doesn't play nice
with the other projects that depend on Django. Using eggs deprecates
the download-cache option.

Other fixes
